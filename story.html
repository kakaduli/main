We have chosen Kakadu plum extract as the base of our formula due to extensive research showing that the people who migrated to Kakadu, Australia 40000 years ago had very healthy skin despite excessive sun exposure. </p>

            <!-- <p class="title">FEEDBACK</p> -->
            <p class="desc">This was due to consuming of Kakadu plum. Kakadu plum has up to 100 times of Vitamin C of oranges and over 100 beneficial ingredients such as Vitamin E and polyphenols  proving it to be the perfect base ingredient for our formula. We also use other natural ingredients such as tasmannia Lanceolata fruit extract and tea tree oil.</p>
