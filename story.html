            <p class="desc">The founder's team of formulas is a nutritionist and pharmacist with more than a decade of research in the field of natural plant and herbal applications in Aboriginal Australia. Around 2010, the prescriber experienced a serious illness. In the early stage, she had some skin problems such as pustules and stains. What's more, endometriosis was found in the subsequent medical reports, and the risk of infertility was very high. It took nearly two years to really overcome the disease, and the prescribers who always adhere to organic diet and fitness habits are constantly thinking and studying the causes of physical problems.

            <p class="title">INQUIRY</p>
            <p class="desc">What attracted the attention of pharmacists was that the content of benzophenone in urine was very high at that time. Through reading a lot of data, the formulators found that many skin care products and cosmetics that had been directly exposed to skin had chemical additives often associated with horrible words such as "endocrine disruptors", "carcinogens" and "irritants". In later life, the formulaist discarded the skin care products and cleaning products used in the past, all of them were modulated by himself, and the raw liquid was prepared with pure natural extracts for daily skin care. </p>

            <p class="title">RESEARCH</p>
            <p class="desc">Formulators initially sent the prepared skin care products to family members and friends for use, conducted research and found different skin problems for each person, and constantly improved the formula products. Later, more and more people from surrounding communities came to use them inexplicably, helping to solve more people's skin problems. Through continuous research and development of indigenous natural plant and herbal ingredients formula, fully proves the efficacy of natural ingredients. For example, the Kakaduli formula is used by the Australian Aboriginal Kakadus to apply it to their skin.</p>

            <p class="desc">The ancestors of the Kakadu people moved to the mainland of Australia from Southeast Asia 40,000 years ago. Although they were exposed to Australian sunshine all the year round, the Kakadu people still have very healthy skin. Recipients found in their research that the fruit had an amazing amount of vitamin C, up to 100 times the content of oranges, and contained more than 100 beneficial ingredients such as vitamin E and polyphenols. Recipients applied its perfect research and development to the product.</p>

            <p class="desc">Not only that, but also Tasmaniago, Alternaria and other ingredients. Formulators benefit from Aboriginal Australian tribes, as well as the research of these natural plants and herbs, and give her knowledge and strength. In order to give feedback and gratitude, we use Yurrah, one of the best words in Aboriginal tribal languages, for brand naming.</p>
